# Code Review Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for code reviews to ensure code quality, security, and maintainability.

## Pre-Review Setup

### Before Starting Review
- [ ] Understand the context and requirements

- [ ] **Consistent Patterns**: Follows established project patterns and conventions

### Naming and Readability
- [ ] **Descriptive Names**: Variables, functions, and classes have clear, descriptive names
- [ ] **Consistent Naming**: Follows project naming conventions
- [ ] **No Magic Numbers**: Hardcoded values are replaced with named constants
- [ ] **Clear Intent**: Code intent is clear without excessive comments
- [ ] **Appropriate Comments**: Comments explain "why" not "what"

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] **Algorithm Efficiency**: Algorithms are reasonably efficient for the use case
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: No obvious memory leaks or excessive allocations
- [ ] **Database Queries**: Efficient queries without N+1 problems
- [ ] **Caching**: Appropriate use of caching where beneficial

## Error Handling and Logging

### Error Management
- [ ] **Comprehensive Error Handling**: All potential errors are properly handled

- [ ] **Error Tracking**: Errors are properly tracked and alertable

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Critical functions have unit tests
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Key workflows have integration tests
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Tests cover edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Tests are well-written and maintainable
- [ ] **Test Data**: Tests use appropriate test data and mocks

### Validation
- [ ] **Functionality**: Code works as intended
- [ ] **Regression Testing**: Changes don't break existing functionality
- [ ] **Cross-Platform**: Code works across target platforms
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Web code works across target browsers
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Performance requirements are met

## Documentation and Maintenance

### Code Documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Public APIs are properly documented
- [ ] **README Updates**: README is updated if needed
- [ ] **Changelog**: Changes are documented in changelog
- [ ] **Migration Guides**: Breaking changes include migration instructions
- [ ] **Architecture Documentation**: Significant changes update architecture docs

### Maintainability
- [ ] **Code Complexity**: Code complexity is reasonable
- [ ] **Technical Debt**: New technical debt is minimized
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Dependencies are appropriate and up-to-date
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Configuration is externalized and documented
- [ ] **Deployment Considerations**: Changes consider deployment requirements

## Project-Specific Checks

### Rust-Specific
- [ ] **Memory Safety**: Proper ownership and borrowing
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Appropriate use of `Result` and `Option` types
- [ ] **Cargo.toml**: Dependencies and metadata are correct
- [ ] **Clippy Warnings**: No clippy warnings or justified suppressions
- [ ] **Formatting**: Code follows `rustfmt` standards

### CLI Applications
- [ ] **Command Interface**: CLI interface is intuitive and consistent
- [ ] **Help Text**: Comprehensive help and usage information
- [ ] **Exit Codes**: Appropriate exit codes for different scenarios
- [ ] **Configuration**: Configuration options are well-designed
- [ ] **Cross-Platform**: Works correctly on target platforms

### Version Management Tools
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Changes maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] **Version Handling**: Version parsing and comparison is robust
- [ ] **File System Operations**: Safe file system operations
- [ ] **Symlink Handling**: Proper symlink creation and management
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of corrupted installations

## Final Review Steps
